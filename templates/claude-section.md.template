## Accord Lite — Architecture-Aware Task Execution

This project uses Accord Lite for architecture-aware development.

### Knowledge Base
- `.accord/module-map.yaml` — module definitions + dependency graph
- `.accord/ARCHITECTURE.md` — one-page architecture overview
- `.accord/contracts/<module>.md` — per-module boundary contracts
- `.accord/plans/` — active and completed execution plans

### Before ANY Task
1. Read `.accord/ARCHITECTURE.md` (always)
2. If task is specific to one module: read that module's contract, execute directly
3. If task spans multiple modules: use `/accord-plan` to plan first

### Rules
- Never modify a module's public API without updating its contract
- Never call an interface not listed in the target module's contract
- Follow the execution order in the plan — do not skip ahead
- After completing a step, update the plan file with actual changes
